## :book: About The Project

AzerothCoreAdmin (_ACAdmin_) is a general interface add-on which will help admins and GMs in-game of AzerothCore-based private servers.

This add-on is an adaption for AzerothCore-based servers of the TrinityAdmin add-on which supports only TrinityCore-based servers. Moreover, TrinityAdmin is derived from MangAdmin, which supports MaNGOS-based server.

A lot of people contributed to make this amazing add-on, it is very hard to list all of them because I don't know much about MangAdmin and TrinityAdmin developers. The _Credits_ section may not be complete, feel free to request a modification.

_The adaption is based on the most updated fork available of TrinityAdmin for 3.3.5a clients, which is maintained and developed by SuperStyro._

<!-- Setup Block -->

## :gear: Getting Started

### Installation

**These steps are required for locales to properly create the new local tables to store tickets and 'who' information'.**

1. Unzip the add-on archive into your _Addons_ folder;
2. **On the server**, you may wish to review the security level requirements for certain GM commands:
    - If your GMs do not have level 4 security level, they wont be able to use the WHO tab;
3. Click the _AzerothCoreAdmin icon_ on the minimap frame. **Do NOT** open AzerothCoreAdmin any other way just yet;
4. Click the _Tickets tab_. If you receive and error, **DO NOT** close it, just click the Tickets tab again;
5. Click the _Change Language button_ to reload the add-on;
6. Click the _AzerothCoreAdmin icon_ on the minimap frame. **Do NOT** open TrinityAdmin any other way just yet;
7. Click the _Who tab_. If you receive and error, **DO NOT** close it, just click the Who tab again;
8. Click the _Change Language button_ to reload the addon;
